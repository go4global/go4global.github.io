	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<h4>How does it all work?</h4>
	<p>Our boosting is a simple and fast service. You will give us your steam username/password and we will play on your account until we reach the desired rank. Our boosters are all high ranked players (Global Elite/Supreme Master First Class) that have been playing the Counter Strike series for many years. If you need any more explanation feel free to contact us on Skype or via email.</p>
	<h4>Is it safe? will my account get banned or stolen?</h4>
	<p>Valve do not ban people for getting boosted. We rely on having a good reputation to keep running our boosting services, not only that, it is not possible to steal steam account or items as long as you have steamguard enabled on your account and do not share the same password with your email and steam account.</p>
	<h4>Can i play during the boosting?</h4>
	<p>We recommend playing on an alternate account or not at all during the boost. Not only can it delay the overall boost but if you try and play whilst we are boosting the account there is a chance of getting MM banned. If you absolutely need to play on the account make sure you contact your booster via skype before so.</p>
	<h4>How can i see boost progress or completion?</h4>
	<p>We will inform you via email and skype once the boost is complete. If you wish to be kept up-to-date on the boost then let us known at the initial purchase and we will send updates via skype/email.</p>
	<h4>What payment methods do you accept? Are refunds available?</h4>
	<p>We currently only accept payments via PayPal and ingame skins or keys. At the moment we only offer a refund if our boosters cannot reach your desired rank.</p>
